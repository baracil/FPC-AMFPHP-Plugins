* Overview *
************

TransactionManager is an AMFPHP plugin that manages database transaction. Before a service is called, 
a transaction is started. If an exception is thrown by the service, the transaction is rollbacked otherwise
the transaction is committed.

This works only if the used database extension is global for all service. The plugin ServicePropertySetter
can be useful for that.
