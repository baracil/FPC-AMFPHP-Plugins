* Overview *
************

FPCAuthentication is an AMFPHP plugin that manages authentication of user with a login
and a password. The login offer two ways to authenticated, a basic and a elaborate one.

The basic method is a simple call to the server with the user login and its secret value
(generally a digest of a password) and the server grants or rejects the access according
to these two values. This method is simple but not 100% secured if not used over a secured
connection (a https connection) since message can be intercepted and even if a digest of
the password is sent, this digest is the password for the server.

The elaborate method is an exchange of 4 messages between the server and the client.
The secret of the user is never sent explicitly nor a direct digest of it. This method
allows the authentication of the user on the server but also the authentication of the
server on the client side. Also, it provides a random password only known by the client
and the server and only valid as long as the user does not logout. This temporary password
can be used to send sensible data to the server without comprising the user password.

*****************
* Compatibility *
*****************

Plugin Version    |     AMFPHP Version
------------------+-------------------
v1.0              |     v2.0

****************
* Installation *
****************

The installation consists in copying to the plugin directory of AMFPHP the directory
'FPCAuthentication' at the same level than this file (not the directory including this file).

*****************
* Configuration *
*****************

The plugins has several configuration parameters but only one is mandatory, all the others have
default values that should be sufficient for most of the cases. Below is the list of the
configuration parameters (the values in parentheses indicate if the parameter is mandatory or not
, and which interface the parameter must implement) :

- 'secretProvider' (mandatory, FPCAuthentication_ISecretProvider) :
This parameter is used to retrieve the user secret from its login.
Below is a very simple example of implementation of such parameter :

class SimpleSecretProvider implements FPCAuthentication_ISecretProvider {
    /**
     * @abstract
     * @param string $login
     * @return string the secret of the user with the given login. The secret is not necessarily
     * the explicit password. The only constraint is that is should be the same thing provided
     * by the client (an operation might then be mandatory between the user input and the call
     * to the server).
     */
    function getSecret($login);
    {
        switch ($login) {
          case "admin" : return "adminPassword";
          case "user1" : return "user1Password";
        }
        return null;
    }
}

Common implementation would access a database to get the secret of the user.



- 'rolesProvider' (optional, FPCAuthentication_IRolesProvider) :
This parameter is used to retrieve the roles of a user. It is used only if the
user is successfully authenticated. Below is a simple implementation of this parameter :

class SimpleRolesProvider implements FPCAuthentication_IRolesProvider {
    /**
     * Called only if the authentication succeed.
     *
     * @param $login login of the authenticated user
     * @return array of string that defines the roles of the authenticated user
     */
    function getRoles($login) {
        switch ($login) {
            case "admin" : return array("USER_INFO_EDITOR", "ORDER_EDITOR", "INVOICE_EDITOR");
            case "user1" : return array("USER_INFO_VIEWER", "ORDER_VIEWER");
        }
        return null;
    }

}

Even if this parameters is optional, the developer might want to change its default behaviour
that is send an empty array, i.e. the user has no roles.



- 'builder' (optional, FPCAuthentication_IBuilder) :
The plugin saves some data during the authentication process and these data are used to create the
result returns by the authentication methods. The transformation of these data is done by this parameter.
The default builder (see below) should be enough but can be modified if more information is needed.

class FPCAuthentication_DefaultBuilder implements FPCAuthentication_IBuilder {

    function build(FPCAuthentication_Result $result)
    {
        if (is_null($result)) {
            return null
        }

        return array(
            'login' => $result->getLogin(),
            'authenticated' => $this->getAuthenticated(),
            'roles' => $this->getRoles(),
            'nbFailedAttempt' => $this->getNbFailedAttempt() );
    }

}



- 'challengeProvider' (optional, FPCAuthentication_IChallengeProvider) :

- 'challengeSolver' (optional, FPCAuthentication_IChallengeProvider) :


***********************
* How to configure it *
***********************

First, the developer needs to create his own implementation of the interface 'FPCAuthentication_IAuthenticator'.
This interface defines the two methods 'authenticate' and 'getRoles'.

The first one gets, as parameters, the login and the password of the user trying to authenticate
and should returns a non-null object if the authentication succeeds, null otherwise.

The method 'getRoles' gets, as parameters, the login and the result of the 'authenticate' method and should returns
a non-null array of string listing the roles attributed to the authenticated user.

A simple implementation could be something like this :

class SimpleAuthenticator implements FPCAuthentication_IAuthenticator {
    /**
     * @param $login login of the user trying to authenticate
     * @param $password password of the user trying to authenticate
     * @return mixed null if the authentication failed, otherwise any not null data.
     * In case of success, the result of this method will be passed as the second parameter
     * of the 'getRoles' method
     */
    function authenticate($login, $password)
    {
        $ok = false;
        if ($login == "admin") {
            $ok = $password == "adminPassword";
        }
        else if ($login == "user1") {
            $ok = $password == "user1";
        }

        return $ok?"something":null;
    }

    /**
     *
     * @param $login login of the user trying to authenticate
     * @param $token the result of the 'authenticate' method.
     * @return array of string that define the roles of the authenticated user
     */
    function getRoles($login, $token)
    {
        //$token is not used but is equal to the string "something"
        if ($login == "admin") {
            return array('USER_RIGHT_EDITOR','USER_INFO_EDITOR', 'USERS_EDITOR');
        }
        else if ($login == "user1") {
            return array('USER_RIGHT_READER','USER_INFO_READER');
        }

        //this should never happen since getRoles is called only if the authentication succeeded
        return array();
    }
}

Then the developer needs to configure the plugin to use this authenticator.
This is done with the default AMFPHP procedure. In the gateway file :

$config->pluginsConfig['FPCPlugin'] = array("authenticator" => new SimpleAuthenticator()));

*****************
* How to use it *
*****************

Assuming the configuration of the plugin is done; the authentication of a user from Flex is simply done
by calling the method 'authenticate' of the "fake service" 'fpclogin'. "fake service" means that the service
does not exist actually, the plugin intercepts any call to a service named fpclogin and handles the called
method.

For instance, you can use something like this :

    public function authenticate(login:String,  password:String):void {
        var gwConnection:NetConnection = new NetConnection();
            gwConnection.connect(URI_TO_THE_AMFPHP_GATEWAY);
            gwConnection.call("fpcplugin/authenticate", new Responder(onSucceed, onFail), login, password);
            gwConnection.close();
    }

    private function onSucceed(response:*):void {
    //user authenticated, proceed.
    }

    private function onFail(response:*):void {
    //authentication failed. Maybe ask again his password.
    }

If the authentication fails, an exception is throw otherwise the plugin returns, by default, an object with the properties
'login' and 'roles' set to the user login and roles (an array of string).

To logout the user, the 'logout' method of the same "fake service" fpclogin must be called. For instance with something like this :

    public function authenticate(login:String,  password:String):void {
        var gwConnection:NetConnection = new NetConnection();
            gwConnection.connect(URI_TO_THE_AMFPHP_GATEWAY);
            gwConnection.call("fpcplugin/logout", new Responder(onLogoutSucceed, onLogoutFail), login, password);
            gwConnection.close();
    }


**********************************
* Integration with ServiceAccess *
**********************************

This plugin is designed to easily work with the ServiceAccess plugin. In fact, if you use FPCAuthentication then
ServiceAccess will work out-of-the-box, no configuration will be needed for it and you will be able
to use annotations to secure your services.

******************************
* Authentication Information *
******************************

After any attempt to authenticate, the plugin saves some data in the session in the form of an associative
array under the key 'FPCAuthenticationResult'. The keys and values of this associative array are the following :

$_SESSION['FPCAuthenticationResult']['authenticated'] = true if the authentication succeeded, false otherwise
$_SESSION['FPCAuthenticationResult']['login'] = the login og the user that tried to authenticate
$_SESSION['FPCAuthenticationResult']['roles'] = the array of string listing the roles attributed to the user, always null if the authentication failed
$_SESSION['FPCAuthenticationResult']['nbFailedAttempt'] = the number of successive failed authentication attempt made by this user.

The data should not be modified.

You can check the 'Examples' folder of the FPC AMFPHP Plugins package.
